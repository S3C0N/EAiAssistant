Developed a parser to analyze and interpret game state files, addressing challenges posed by inconsistent patterns in the file structure. To handle unknown instances effectively, created separate dictionaries to categorize these cases. This iterative approach aims to identify meaningful patterns specific to gameplay scenarios, enabling accurate information extraction and ensuring precise control over the database used for future AI training.
