So far created Gamestate parser but it has difficulty with encapsulating all cases. It seems the gamestate file doesnt always follow a pattern. 
so I have created seperate dictionaries for unknown instances in file.
this way i can maybe create a pattern that makes sense with the game that i was playing, to extract useful information from file
This is so I can control the database the future AI will be pulling from when training
